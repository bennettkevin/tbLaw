            <h1>About Tabetha</h1>
            <p>
                I am a licensed Florida attorney dedicated to guiding clients through some of lifeâ€™s most 
                difficult challenges. Before opening my own practice, I served as an Assistant State 
                Attorney where I gained invaluable experience and a deep understanding of how cases are 
                built and prosecuted. That background allows me to offer legal strategies and provide my 
                clients with a strong, informed defense.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion lies in two areas of the law that touch people most personally: criminal defense 
                and family law. Whether protecting your rights in a criminal case or helping you navigate sensitive 
                family matters, I approach every client with compassion, determination, and a commitment to achieving 
                the best outcome given your specific case. As a solo practitioner, I offer personalized attention, 
                direct communication, and dedicated advocacy every step of the way.
